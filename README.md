Hereâ€™s what the script does in simple terms:

1. **Turning Navigation Mode On/Off**:
   - Press `CapsLock` to turn on a special mode where the `h`, `j`, `k`, and `l` keys act like arrow keys.
   - When the mode is on, the Caps Lock light turns on, and a message saying "Navigation Mode ON" pops up for a second.
   - Press `CapsLock` again to turn the mode off, which also turns off the Caps Lock light and shows "Navigation Mode OFF."

2. **Using the Arrow Keys**:
   - While the mode is on:
     - `h` moves the cursor left, `j` moves it down, `k` moves it up, and `l` moves it right.
   - If you hold down the `Shift` key while using `h`, `j`, `k`, or `l`, it will select text as you move the cursor.

3. **Normal Keyboard**:
   - When the mode is off, the `h`, `j`, `k`, and `l` keys just type the letters, like normal.
